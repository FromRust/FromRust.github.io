ONGOING
- add more to the results pane?
--- added some, but need more on this probably
- UI: color-code cards by character or add some separation

TO-DO
- for level up mode, specify a target level
- flag cards as not droppable and/or not purchaseable
- add new result panes so we can do comparisons
- drop rate sim: sort collection by type then #
- add rarity assignment to card screen

REFACTOR
- how we store card/card data - everything should just be refs to the cardData objects honestly, no more of this store-by-name crap or whatever
