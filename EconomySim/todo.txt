- add more to the results pane?
--- added some, but need more on this
- show cards by characters? use colors for this maybe?
- for Level Up mode, randomly pick between characters
--- also, specify a level target
- drop rate - pick a type then tier then among the tier
- flag cards as not droppable and/or not purchaseable
- (maybe) figure out a way to do version control w/ the local storage data
